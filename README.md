Hi there, Iâ€™m NoseAlien.

I have a keen interest in Embedded Systems and Machine Learning. Currently, I am learning MicroPython programming, C language, STM32 development, and Machine Vision.

I owe a great deal to my friends [CloverGit](https://github.com/CloverGit) and [huaidang123](https://github.com/huaidang123) for their selfless support and guidance throughout my learning journey. In the future, I am eager to delve into Linux and set up servers.

Feel free to reach me at my email: nosealien2004@gmail.com
