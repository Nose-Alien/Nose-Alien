Hi, I’m NoseAlien.

I have a keen interest in Embedded Systems and Machine Learning. Currently, I am learning MicroPython programming, C language, STM32 development, and Machine Vision.

I owe a great deal to my friend CloverGit for his selfless support and guidance throughout my learning journey. In the future, I am eager to delve into Linux and set up servers.

Feel free to reach me at my email: 22845946999@qq.com
